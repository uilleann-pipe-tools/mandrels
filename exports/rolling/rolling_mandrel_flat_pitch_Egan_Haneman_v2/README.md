After a conversation with Bill, he said that staple blank sizes for Egan chanters
can range from 0.540-0.520" on the wide end to 0.520-0.500" on the small end; thus,
this staple was designed at his request to fit a staple with intermediate values: a blank 
of 0.530" at the wide end and 0.510" small end.  It was ensured that the 0.540" side could be rolled
on the mandrel (i.e., it was wide enough at its wide end); likewise for the 0.500" on the 
small end of the mandrel.
